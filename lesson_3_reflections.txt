WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING YOUR WORK LOCAL? 

  So you can collaborate, work from multiple machines, and back up your repositories. 


WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP TO DATE WITH REMOTE?

	That way if you working on changes, it wont overwrite them automatically and mess up your work in progress.
