WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INITIALZE A REPOSITORY? WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO IT? 


	When you intialze a repository, you create a .git folder in the current directory. 

	This lets git do its thing, idk the technicals behind it. 

	You need to do this so that you can use git in the directory. 

	You still need to make your first commit manually. 


STAGING AREA
	
		The staging area is the inbetween of the WD and the repository. Gives the user control over what goes into the repository for each commit. 


HOW CAN YOU USE THE STAGIN AREA TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ONE COMMIT PERLOGICAL CHANGE?

	You can make commits on a good work process. 

	You can use the command to compare the staging area with the latest commit. 

		git diff --staged


WHEN USE BRANCHES? 

	Branches are good for experimental changes, or any other alterations that completely change the main path of the project. 


HOW DO DIAGRAMS HELP VISUALIZE BRANCH STRUCTUE? 

	They show you the backpropogating linear structure of the commits, and how they are only accessible from certain points. This being said, care should be taken when developing their structures so that the changes you want to have access too are saved as commits. 


	When making a commit: you can use "git commit -b "branch name" to make a new branch ". 



WHAT IS THE RESULT OF MERGING TWO BRANCHES TOGETHER? 

	It results in the chronological merging of the two commit lines into a single branch. The branch itself can then be removed, as it is no longer needed to access the commits whithin it, as it has been merged.
